# Castlegate IT WP Yoast Import #

Castlegate IT WP Yoast Import is a simple tool for migrating titles and descriptions from the Castlegate IT [ACF SEO](https://github.com/castlegateit/cgit-wp-acf-seo) and [SEO Redux](https://github.com/castlegateit/cgit-wp-seo-redux) plugins to [Yoast](https://yoast.com/).
